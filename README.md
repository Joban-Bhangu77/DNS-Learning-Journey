# DNS-Learning-Journey

his repository presents a detailed, command-line-driven exploration of the Domain Name System (DNS), focusing on its core architecture, operational mechanics, and practical use cases. Designed for network engineers, system administrators, and learners preparing for certifications, this project outlines key DNS functionalities and supports them with hands-on command-line examples.

üîß Project Scope:
Overview of DNS hierarchy, root servers, and resolution flow

Detailed breakdown of DNS record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, TXT, SOA)

Configuration of forward and reverse DNS lookups

Use of diagnostic tools such as dig, nslookup, host, and whois

DNS cache inspection and flushing techniques

Analysis of DNS propagation, TTL, and zone delegation

Real-world scenarios for troubleshooting and resolution testing

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:
Vendor-agnostic command-line focus (Linux/Unix and Windows compatible)

Structured sections with examples and outputs

Practical use of BIND-based commands and local host DNS testing

Suitable for both lab practice and real-world troubleshooting reference

This project serves as a foundational DNS knowledge base for infrastructure engineers, cybersecurity analysts, and DevOps professionals who work with name resolution, server management, or network design.
